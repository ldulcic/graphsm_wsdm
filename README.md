Graph Space Model (WSDM'14)

This is the code for the graph document model ss described in Michael Schuhmacher and Simone Paolo Ponzetto: Knowledge-based Graph Document Modeling. In Proceedings of WSDM'14, pp. 543-552, ACM, 2014 ([paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2556195.2556250),  [presentation](http://dws.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/fileadmin/lehrstuehle/ki/pub/michael/WSDM14_Schuhmacher_Knowledge-based_Graph_Document_Modeling.pdf))

Note that this code is not really running out of the box. It's more a resource for you to copy&paste some Java code.

Also third party dataset are not provided, as I can not redistributed those without permission. Folders where third-party data are need.
